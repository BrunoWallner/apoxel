# Apoxel
A multiplayer post-apocalyptic voxel-based game.

## How to run
1. You have to first start `Rust/server`.
2. Then you can run `Rust/client`.

## How to play
- you can dig tunnels by pressing the left mouse button
- you can even connect to the server with multiple clients, but you have to change the username in `client/src/communication/plugin.rs`

## Note
I am not using the `querty` keyboard layout, so the character controller is a bit messed up
